Traffic Accident Severity Prediction in Seoul
This project aims to build a classification model to predict the severity of injuries (minor injury, serious injury, or no injury) in traffic accidents that occurred in Seoul, South Korea.
By analyzing the traffic accident data, the project seeks to identify key factors that influence the severity of incidents and provide valuable insights to support the development of traffic safety policies and response strategies.

## Objectives:
- Predict the level of injury sustained by accident victims using classification models.
- Analyze which variables most significantly impact accident severity.

## Model Comparison
In this project, we compared the performance of several classification models to predict the severity of injuries from traffic accidents:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost

Each model was evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Through comparison, we aimed to identify which model performs best in predicting injury severity and gain insights into feature importance and model interpretability.

NOTE: This project is a prototype created for learning purposes.
